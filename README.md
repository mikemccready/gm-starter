# GM Starter: Smart Contract and dApp Development Kit

## Introduction

This repository is designed to be a quick start environment for decentralized applications and smart contract development.

Leveraging the technologies of Hardhat, Next.js, and Wagmi, this kit provides a foundation for building your dApps.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardhat**: An Ethereum development environment that facilitates building smart contracts, running tests, and debugging code.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **Wagmi**: A set of React Hooks that make it easier to connect, interact, and display information from Ethereum.

## Hardhat commands

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## DApp frontend startup

```shell
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```
